Management System â€“ Service-Oriented Architecture

This project was developed as part of the software development unit, with a focus on implementing a service-oriented architecture using .NET Framework 4.8 for the API, 
WPF with .NET 8 for the client application, and SQL Server hosted on Azure for data persistence.

Technical Architecture

The solution is structured in three main layers:

	1.	Database (SQL Server - Azure)
Relational model with multiple tables, designed to support all operations of the system.

	2.	API (ASP.NET Web API - .NET Framework 4.8)
RESTful API built using LINQ to SQL, responsible for data exposure and business logic.

	3.	Client Application (WPF - .NET 8)
Desktop interface that consumes the API exclusively for all operations, built with modern WPF features.

How to Run the Project
	1.	Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/JuaciraQuissueiaRosa/ProjetoGestaoEscolar.git

	2.	API:
	â€¢	Requirements: Visual Studio 2022, .NET Framework 4.8
	â€¢	Open the API project and run it locally or access the deployed version.
	â€¢	Live API URL
	3.	Client (WPF):
	â€¢	Requirements: .NET 8 SDK
	â€¢	Open the WPF project in Visual Studio or compatible IDE.
	â€¢	Run the project; it will connect automatically to the API hosted on Azure : (https://schoolapi.azurewebsites.net)

Final Notes

This project showcases my ability to design and implement a real-world, service-oriented system following object-oriented programming principles. 
It is part of my professional portfolio and reflects the skills I am prepared to apply in a Junior Developer position.
